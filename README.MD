# Spotify Tempo/Key Playlist Sorter

This Python application utilizes the Spotify API to retrieve songs from playlists, extract their tempo and key information, and create a new playlist that progressively increases in tempo. Additionally, it stores the generated playlist in a text file for future reference.

Features:
- Fetches songs from specified Spotify playlists using the Spotify API.
- Retrieves tempo and key information for each song.
- Generates a new playlist with the collected songs.
- Progressively increases the tempo of the playlist for an energetic listening experience.
- Stores the created playlist in a text file for easy access and sharing.

This application leverages the Spotipy library, which provides a Python interface for the Spotify Web API. By combining playlist manipulation, audio analysis, and file I/O, it offers a convenient way to curate dynamic and tempo-changing playlists.

Getting started:
1. Set up your Spotify application and obtain the client ID and client secret in order to stash it in the code. (THIS WILL NOT WORK WITHOUT THE CLIENT ID AND CLIENT SECRET)
2. Configure the necessary environment variables or a configuration file to store the client ID and client secret securely.
3. Run the application, specifying the target playlist and other desired settings.
4. Enjoy your new tempo-progressing playlist and find the generated playlist stored in a text file for future use.

Feel free to customize and enhance the application according to your needs and preferences. Happy playlist creation and music exploration!
